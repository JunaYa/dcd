# DCD 松一刻 — Disconnect · Circulate · Decompress

## Development

Use Node.js 24.11+ and pnpm 12.5.1. Rust 1.96 is selected by `rust-toolchain.toml`.

```sh
npm install -g pnpm@12.5.1
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm tauri dev
```

Vite 8 uses Rolldown and Oxc. Run `pnpm lint` for Oxlint, `pnpm fmt` for Oxfmt,
`pnpm test` for Vitest, and `pnpm build` for Vue type checking and the production build.
Run native tests with `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --lib`.
The development server uses port 1422.

TypeScript is kept on 6.0.3 because vue-tsc 3.3.11 still requires the JavaScript
compiler API removed in TypeScript 7. Upgrade them together once vue-tsc supports it.

The historical origins of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Shinto/Taoism have profoundly shaped their cultural and societal impact in East Asia, influencing governance, social structures, and cultural practices.

### **Buddhism**
Originating in India in the 6th century BCE, Buddhism spread to East Asia through the Silk Road and maritime routes, reaching China in the 1st century CE. Its emphasis on personal enlightenment, meditation, and the impermanence of life resonated with East Asian cultures. In China, Buddhism adapted to local traditions, blending with Taoist and Confucian ideas, and influenced art, architecture, and literature. It also introduced institutional structures, such as monasteries, which were later adopted by Taoism. In Japan, Buddhism merged with Shinto, creating a unique syncretic tradition, while in Korea, it coexisted with native shamanistic practices, influencing temple architecture and rituals. Across East Asia, Buddhism's teachings on compassion and mindfulness have left a lasting legacy on cultural values and practices.

### **Confucianism**
Confucianism, founded by Confucius in 6th century BCE China, is more a philosophy than a religion, focusing on ethics, social harmony, and proper relationships. It became the foundation of Chinese governance and education, particularly during the Han Dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), where it was institutionalized as the state ideology. Confucian values, such as filial piety, respect for hierarchy, and the importance of education, deeply influenced societal structures in China, Korea, and Japan. Even today, Confucian principles underpin East Asian cultural norms, emphasizing family, community, and social responsibility.

### **Taoism**
Taoism, emerging in China around the 4th century BCE, emphasizes living in harmony with the Tao ("the Way"), a natural order of the universe. Its focus on simplicity, non-action (wu-wei), and balance influenced Chinese medicine, science, and the arts. Taoism's integration with Buddhism led to mutual enrichment, particularly in areas like meditation and cosmology. Its spiritual and philosophical ideas also shaped Chinese literature and visual arts, promoting a deep connection with nature.

### **Shinto**
Shinto, Japan's indigenous religion, evolved from nature worship and animism, emphasizing the veneration of kami (spirits). It later incorporated elements of Buddhism and Confucianism, creating a unique religious and cultural identity. Shinto's focus on rituals and festivals has preserved traditional Japanese customs and reinforced national identity. Its integration with Buddhism, particularly during the Heian period, influenced Japanese art, architecture, and governance.

### **Cultural and Societal Impact**
The interplay of these traditions has created a rich tapestry of cultural and societal norms in East Asia. Confucianism provided a framework for social order and governance, Taoism inspired harmony with nature and scientific inquiry, and Buddhism offered spiritual solace and artistic inspiration. Shinto reinforced Japan's cultural identity and connection to nature. Together, these traditions have shaped East Asia's values, aesthetics, and societal structures, leaving an enduring legacy.
